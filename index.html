      <h2>Life and Legacy</h2>
  <p>José Rizal was a Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary whose ideas and works helped shape the nation’s fight for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. Born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, he grew up in a prosperous family that valued education. A gifted student, Rizal excelled in academics, medicine, and the arts, and was fluent in several languages.</p>

<p>His two novels, Noli Me Tangere (1887) and El Filibusterismo (1891), courageously exposed the injustices, corruption, and abuses of the Spanish colonial government and the friar-dominated church. Though he advocated peaceful reform rather than violent revolution, his writings awakened Filipino nationalism and united people in the call for change.</p>

<p>Rizal traveled and studied abroad, but always kept the welfare of his country at heart. He returned to the Philippines in 1892 and founded La Liga Filipina, a civic organization promoting peaceful reform. Arrested and exiled to Dapitan for four years, he continued to teach, treat the sick, and promote community projects.</p>

<p>In 1896, at the height of the Philippine Revolution, Rizal was accused of sedition and rebellion. Despite little evidence, he was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896, at Bagumbayan (now Luneta Park) in Manila. His courage, intellect, and sacrifice made him a martyr and the country’s foremost national hero.</p>
